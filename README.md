# Zepto_sql_project
This project showcases an end-to-end SQL analysis of Zeptoâ€™s ecommerce inventory data. I cleaned messy real world data, explored product level insights, and derived key business metrics using PostgreSQL. The project includes a detailed business report highlighting trends in pricing, stock, and category wise performance.
