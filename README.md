# Zepto E-Commerce SQL Analysis Project

This project is a hands-on simulation of how data analysts in the ecommerce domain work with real-world data to drive business decisions. Using a publicly available dataset originally scraped from Zepto’s product listings (via Kaggle), I performed end to end analysis covering data cleaning, exploratory insights, and business logic understanding all using *PostgreSQL*.

###  Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL  
- pgAdmin  
- SQL (Data Cleaning, EDA, Business Queries)  
- Excel (for data checks and formatting)

###  Project Highlights
- Cleaned and structured raw e commerce data  
- Analyzed stock availability, pricing inconsistencies, and discount trends  
- Derived key business insights such as best value products, high MRP out of stock items, and category wise revenue potential  

A detailed business report based on this analysis is also included in the repository.
